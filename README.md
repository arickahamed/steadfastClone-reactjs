Technology - Reactjs, tailwind CSS, netlify (host)
Steps - First I created a folder structure for all the files (pages, images, assets, etc.). Then I installed the tailwind css for the betterment of styling the elements. Then I created the navigation bar for small, medium, and large screen sizes. After that, I installed React Router Dom to link the pages. Then created the hero section and made a text overlay on it.After that I put some data in the assets folder so that I could import those and use them with the help of the map function (js2015, a built-in function that works the same as the for loop and is very powerful) . Then I make sure that all the elements are responsive for all the devices. When I created the navigation I make sure the design look a like to the steadfast design , while the screen scroll in the vertical direction the background of the navigation should change, and all the stuff. I have done it with the help of window.scroll method.
Issues - after finishing the project when decided to deploy the project to netlify the background image was not showing because the external CSS class name clashed with the tailwind css class. after that, I made the same CSS in internal CSS and used it in the style tag, and then it worked fine after deploying.
